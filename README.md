# BUAA-Android-Development
### 0x00 Introduction
Course work for BUAA B3J063860 Android Development.  
This is a static demo for Gundam fans providing latest release news, fans forums and Gundam wiki (free comics inside).  
Due to limited time and effort, I cannot gather enough data to build up a backend database to provide full functional version of this app.  
Thus, I focus on frontend design and user interface aiming at providing smooth and elegant User Experience in this demo.
