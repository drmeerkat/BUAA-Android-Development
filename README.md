# BUAA-Android-Development
### 0x00 Introduction
Course work for BUAA B3J063860 Android Development.  
This is a static demo for Gundam fans providing latest release news, fans forums and Gundam wiki (free comics inside).  
Due to limited time and effort, I cannot gather enough data to build up a backend database to provide full functional version of this app.  
Thus, I focus on frontend design and user interface aiming at providing smooth and elegant User Experience in this demo.  
(Try as hard as I can to follow [Android Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/))

My favourite part of this demo is the information stream design. As you can see, our demo has dynamic segments adapting different blocks to different types of contents, and all the segments together constitute our info stream.
